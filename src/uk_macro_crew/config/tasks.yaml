    Conduct research on {topic} to find the latest available data for each UK economic indicator, knowing that today's date is {current_date}.

    Your goal is to find the most recent UK economic data for these indicators:
    - Interest Rate (Bank of England base rate)
    - CPIH +/- MoM (Consumer Price Index including Housing month-over-month)
    - GDP +/- MoM (Gross Domestic Product month-over-month)
    
    AND the latest Bank of England report summaries:
    - Monetary Policy Report (latest BoE policy decisions and economic outlook)
    - Financial Stability Report (latest BoE financial system assessment - published twice yearly in June/December)

    SEARCH STRATEGY - CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Use EXASearchTool ONE SEARCH AT A TIME - never pass arrays or multiple queries
    2. Each tool call must use this EXACT format: {"search_query": "your search term"}
    3. Do NOT use any other parameters - only search_query
    4. PRIORITIZE official sources: ONS (ons.gov.uk) for CPIH/GDP, Bank of England (bankofengland.co.uk) for rates/MPC
    5. Focus on finding the LATEST available data for each indicator - prioritize December 2025 and January 2026 data
    6. Search term variations to try:
       - Interest Rate: "UK interest rate latest 2026" or "Bank of England base rate January 2026" or "BoE rate cut December 2025"
       - CPIH: "ONS CPIH November 2025 monthly" or "Consumer Price Index housing ONS latest" or "UK inflation November 2025 ONS"
       - GDP: "ONS GDP monthly October November 2025" or "UK monthly GDP latest ONS" or "GDP monthly estimate UK November 2025"
       - Monetary Policy Report: "Bank of England December 2025 rate cut 3.75%" or "BoE MPC December 17 2025" or "Bank Rate reduced December 2025"
       - Financial Stability Report: "Bank of England Financial Stability Report latest 2026" or "BoE financial stability December 2025"
    7. IMPORTANT: Always include the sign for percentage changes (e.g., +0.1%, -0.1%, +0.0%)
    8. IMPORTANT: Verify data accuracy with official sources (ONS for CPIH/GDP, BoE for rates/MPC)
    9. If first search fails, try alternative terms in separate tool calls
    10. IMPORTANT: For Financial Stability Report, if no recent report found (they're published twice yearly), simply state "Data not found" - do NOT create placeholder content

    CRITICAL: Never pass arrays to EXASearchTool. Always use single objects with only search_query parameter.
  expected_output: >
    A bullet point list with the latest available data for each indicator and report summary:
    
    - Interest Rate: [value]% ([month-year])
    - CPIH +/- MoM: [+/-value]% ([month-year])
    - GDP +/- MoM: [+/-value]% ([month-year])
    - Monetary Policy Report Summary: [brief summary of key decisions and outlook] ([month-year])
    - Financial Stability Report Summary: [brief summary of financial system assessment OR "Data not found"] ([month-year])
    
    NOTE: Financial Stability Reports are published twice yearly (June/December). If no recent report is available, use "Data not found".

    Take the research data and update the JSON report.
    
    You will receive simple bullet points with economic data.
    Your job is to add this new data to the existing JSON report while preserving all existing data.
    
    Use the JSON Update Tool to merge the new data with the existing report.
    
    The existing JSON report is: {json_report}
  expected_output: >
    Return the complete updated JSON report as pure JSON with no formatting.
    
    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Return ONLY the JSON object - no markdown code blocks, no backticks, no explanatory text
    2. Do not wrap the JSON in ```json or ``` 
    3. The output must be valid JSON that can be parsed directly
    4. Preserve the existing created_at date from the original report
    5. Update the updated_at date to today's date
    
    The JSON structure should be:
    {
      "metadata": {
        "updated_at": "2026-01-11",
        "created_at": "[preserve original date]"
      },
      "economic_indicators": {
        "interest_rate": [...],
        "cpih_mom": [...],
        "gdp_mom": [...]
      },
      "report_summaries": {
        "monetary_policy_report": [...],
        "financial_stability_report": [...]
      }
    }
